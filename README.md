# Chris Bramley's case study
## Overview and Origin 
* Stripe is the name of the company
*Stripe was founded in 2010 in Palo Alto,CA
*The founders of stripe are brothers Patrick and John Collison
* The idea of stripe came about when the two brothers were trying to figure out why payments over the web were consistently so difficult and they wanted to see if they could make it more simple
*This company has been funded through multiple series of funding rounds 22 to be exact by 15 lead investers raising a total of 8.7 Billion dollars in funding

## Buisness activities
*The financial problem stripe was created to solve is the difficulty of web based payments and checking out on online shops
* The companys intended customer is web based stores that would like an easier option for their customers at checkout to simplify the purchase proccess with the E-commerce boom of recent years the market size of customers is vast and ever growing.
*The unfair advantage Stripe has is the ease of use, flecibility and affordabilty they offer. They began in 2010 when E-commerce was just truly beggining to gain traction starting so early they were able develop one line of code that can make proccesing payments for online stores so quick and easy giving them a monopoly over online payment proccesors 
*Currently Stripe is utilizing Machine learning to respond to it's users changing and advancing problems as well as to block prevent and become aware of fraudulant behaviors. They have also switched Stripes biggest Javascript code base from flow to Typescript. with a single pull request they converted over 3.7 milllion lines of code.


## Landscape
* The domain of Stripe is payments/Billing
* The payments/billing domain has been blowing up recently. Due to the pandemic contactless payment has been what's new and trending in the domain. With advances such as apple pay, contactless cards, venmo pay this domain has been blessed with a surplus of innovation. Before the contactless payment systems online checkouts becoming easier to use and simple was the leading trend. Being able to save your cards information to your phone was payment tech that no one even believed was posssible.
* With payment proccessors the compettition is fierce and wide spread. Company's like paypal,Square,and Clover are all direct compettitors of stripe fighting for customers and trying to pull ahead of one another.


## Results
* Stripe has made a direct impact on the E-commerce industry as well as the retail industry. Companies like Amazon, Apple, aliexpress, Target, Etsy, Walmart, and so many more rely on stripe as their payment proccesor. Their cheap pricing plans have also given many E-commerce companies the ability to have secure payments without being robbed on the amount they would pay. They have completly changed the game and have disrupted the industry of online and in person transactions. 

* Some core metrics that can measure a company in this domains success would be the valuation of the company, the amount of patents they have, and how many websites use them as their payment proccesor. Stripe is valued at 94.4 billion dollars, They have 48 patents, and they have 3.1 million websites currently using them as their payment proccesor. Using these metrics I would say that Stripe is on the cutting edge of the industry and and is well on route to becoming a titan in the payment proccesing domain. 
* The domain of payment proccessing is very competetive with paypal, Block , Stripe, and Chime all fighting for their respective spot as number one. Stripe has tripled its Valuation since 2019 and is the fastest growing. However company valuation is led by Paypal and than Square. 

##Recomendations 

* After researching stripes compettitors like square, paypal, and chime I've come to the conclusion that they need to create an app for simple money transfers to take that benefit away from paypal as well as offer a credit card that is not solely a buisness card. With these two offerings if done properly Stripe can grow outwards and take away market space from paypal the leader in their domain.
 
*This service would require coding to develop the application for money transfers as well as strong data protection technologies for a money transfer system. the credit card would require a strong internal banking system so they can offer a credit card to common people rather than just a buisness card. They would need to develop software to run credit checks and a system to either approve or dissaprove of people applying for said card posibly impelemnting ai or machine learning of some sort to calculate risk. 

* This technology is appropriate because code is the way all apps are developed whether it is c++, python, java script or any of them it is needed to create applications. Due to the fact the app will be designed to transfer money you will want a strong data protection field so people are not having their identities stolen because that would most likely lose you customers. Stripe already offers a buisness card so a card for the common people is not a worlds away. They would just need to create a system to approve or dissaprove people based off their data and the significance of it.
